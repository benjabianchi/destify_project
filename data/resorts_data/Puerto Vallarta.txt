There are playgrounds and kids pools after entering the lobby that is geared towards families. My favorite pool was the one located on the right of the resort. I never thought I would like having the hotel/beach detached from the resort, but they designed it in a way that makes sense. 
Nizu is definitely the restaurant that this hotel is known for, located on the top level they serve dishes from all over the world in a tapas style. Great for sharing and having drinks! The sunset up here was beautiful.
